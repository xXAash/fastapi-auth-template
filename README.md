# Money App â€“ Personal Financial Tracker

## Overview

Money App is a modular, microservice-based application designed to help users gain control over their finances by tracking:

- Spending and income
- Savings goals and automatic transfers
- Investment accounts (e.g., Roth IRA, 401k)
- Debts and loan payments
- Credit card usage, rewards, and due dates

The app prioritizes simplicity, clarity, and security, and is built with scalability in mind.
